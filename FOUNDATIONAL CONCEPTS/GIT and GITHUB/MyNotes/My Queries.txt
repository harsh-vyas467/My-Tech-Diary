If you have staged two files, one.txt and two.txt, using the command git add ., and then modify the file one.py, then the status will show that one.py is modified and two.txt is staged. When you run git commit, only the staged version of two.txt and the older version of one.py will be committed. The modified version of one.py will not be part of the commit. To include the changes in the commit, you will need to stage the modified version of one.py using git add one.py before running git commit.
