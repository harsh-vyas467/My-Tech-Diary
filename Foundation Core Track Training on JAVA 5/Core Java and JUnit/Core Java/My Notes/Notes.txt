# History:

James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems develop Java as a programming language in the mid-1990s.

Java was originally designed for interactive television, but the language was too advanced for the industry at the time.

Java was released as a public beta in 1995, and the first official version of the language was released in 1996.

Java was designed to be portable and secure, making it well-suited for use on the internet.

The language quickly gained popularity among developers due to its "write once, run anywhere" capability, allowing developers to write code that can run on any platform without modification.

In 2010, Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle Corporation, which continues to develop and maintain the Java language.

Today, Java is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world and is used for a variety of applications, including desktop applications, web applications, mobile applications, and more.

-----------------------------------------

Java applications are platform independent, meaning they can run on any operating system.

The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is responsible for executing the Java code and is platform independent.

The JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is specific to a particular operating system and architecture and is required to run Java applications.

The JDK (Java Development Kit) is a bundle that contains both the JRE and development tools needed to develop and run Java applications. It is also specific to a particular operating system and architecture.

If you are developing Java applications, you will need to install the JDK, which includes the JRE and JVM, on your development machine.

If you only want to run Java applications, you can install the JRE.
